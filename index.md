Hello, my name is Kateřina and I'm curious about data visualization & data analysis.

## Experience

### 2019–ongoing: Junior Business Intelligence Specialist

## Courses

### 2019: Digital Academy by Czechitas

Three-month-long intensive course on data analysis. The skills gained were synthesized in a project, where I and my friend Lenka researched the impact of the weather on criminality in Brno and NYC. See its outcomes [here](https://dabrno.blogspot.com/2019/06/kolouchova-tomesova.html) (available in Czech only).

## Education

### Master's degree in Economic Policy and International Relations (Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia)
